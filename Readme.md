# Hi there! 👋

I am a 15-year-old coding enthusiast focused on building functional projects and learning how things work under the hood.

### 🛠 What I do
* **Java:** My main language. I use it for the majority of my projects and feel the most comfortable here.
* **C++:** Currently learning this hobbistically to expand my logic and low-level understanding.
* **Web Development:** I can build functional websites. I’m not a professional designer, but I can get a site up and running with a decent look.

### 💡 My Approach
I value authenticity over "over-engineered" code. I focus on solving real problems and keeping it real. While I occasionally use AI to assist with the workflow, the core logic is always mine. 

**Note:** I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with **optimization**—sometimes I get obsessed with making things run as efficiently as possible.
